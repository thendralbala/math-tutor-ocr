        "text": "Preface\n\nThis substantially revised book is the first of two volumes that amalgamate the previous editions of *Text &amp; Tests* 4, 5, 6 and 7 into two books for the Higher Level Leaving Certificate Project Maths course. *Text &amp; Tests* 4 encompasses more than 55% of the course.\n\nAs a Fifth-Year book, it introduces students to all five strands of the course and fully reflects the overall approach to the teaching of Maths as stated in the learning outcomes for Project Maths. It encourages the development of not only the students' knowledge and skills but also the understanding necessary to apply these skills.\n\nThe extensive range of imaginatively written and probing questions on each topic will help students understand the concepts involved and develop their problem-solving skills. Every attempt has been made to grade the questions in order of difficulty.\n\nAt the beginning of each chapter, there is a list of Key Words that students are expected to know and understand when the chapter is completed.\n\nEach chapter concludes with a three-part revision exercise section consisting of (a) Core, (b) Advanced, and (c) Extended Response questions.\n\nThe Higher Level course will be completed by the new edition of *Text &amp; Tests* 5.\n\nO.

Addition and subtraction of polynomial expressions\n\nEach term in a polynomial represents a different quantity, e.g. $8, 6x, 4x^2$.\n\nWhen simplifying an expression, all like terms should be combined into a single term.\n\n# Example 1\n\nExpand and simplify each of the following expressions.\n\n(i) $7(x^{3} + 2x^{2} - 5x) - 2(2 + 3x + 4x^{2} - 2x^{3})$\n(ii) $3x^{2}(4x^{2} - 5x + 6) + 4x(8x^{3} - 2x - 3)$",

Multiplying polynomial expressions\n\nTo multiply algebraic expressions, we use the distributive law, i.e. $a(b + c) = ab + ac$.\n\n### Example 2\n\nSimplify the following: $(x - 5)(2x^{2} - 3x + 6)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}\n(x - 5)(2x^{2} - 3x + 6) = x(2x^{2} - 3x + 6) - 5(2x^{2} - 3x + 6) \\\\\n= 2x^{3} - 3x^{2} + 6x - 10x^{2} + 15x - 30 \\\\\n= 2x^{3} - 13x^{2} + 21x - 30 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n**Note:** Multiplying polynomial expressions is often called *expanding*.\n\n## 3. Perfect squares\n\nAny polynomial of the form $(x + a)^2$ is called a perfect square.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}\n(x + a)^{2} = (x + a)(x + a) \\\\\n= (x)(x + a) + (a)(x + a) \\\\\n= x^{2} + ax + ax + a^{2} \\\\\n= x^{2} + 2ax + a^{2} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, $(x - a)^2 = x^2 - 2ax + a^2$.\n\nFor example, $(2x - 3)^{2} = (2x)^{2} - 2(2x)(3) + (3)^{2} = 4x^{2} - 12x + 9$\n\n$(x + a)^{2} = x^{2} + 2ax + a^{2}$\n\n$(x - a)^{2} = x^{2} - 2ax + a^{2}$\n\n### Example 3\n\nGiven that $25x^{2} + px + 16$ is a perfect square and $p &gt; 0$, find the value of $p$.\n\nSince $25x^{2} = (5x)^{2}$ and $16 = (4)^{2}$, $\\therefore 25x^{2} + px + 16 = (5x + 4)^{2}$\n\n$\\therefore 2(5x)(4) = px$\n\n$\\therefore 40x = px \\Rightarrow p = 40.$\n\n(Note: $16 = (-4)^{2}$ $\\therefore 2(5x)(-4) = px \\Rightarrow p = -40$, which is not valid because $p &gt; 0$)",

The Sine Rule: $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}$\n\nTo prove the Sine rule $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B}$\n\n![img-128.jpeg](img-128.jpeg)\nProof (i) Acute angled triangle\n\ni) $\\frac{h}{b} = \\sin A \\Rightarrow h = b \\sin A$\nii) $\\frac{h}{a} = \\sin B \\Rightarrow h = a \\sin B$\n$\\therefore a \\sin B = b \\sin A$\n\nIn both cases if we divide by $\\sin A \\sin B$ we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B}\n$$\n\nSimilarly it may be shown that $\\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}$\n\n$$\n\\therefore \\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}\n$$\n\nSine Rule $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}$ or $\\frac{\\sin A}{a} = \\frac{\\sin B}{b} = \\frac{\\sin C}{c}$\n\nMandatory Proof\n\n![img-129.jpeg](img-129.jpeg)\n(ii) Obtuse angled triangle\n\ni) $\\frac{h}{b} = \\sin A \\Rightarrow h = b \\sin A$\nii) $\\frac{h}{a} = \\sin(180^{\\circ} - B) \\Rightarrow h = a \\sin(180^{\\circ} - B)$\n\n$\\Rightarrow h = a \\sin B$  (since $(180^{\\circ} - B)$ is in the $2^{\\text{nd}}$ quadrant with reference angle $B$ and sine is $(+)^{\\text{ve}}$ in the $2^{\\text{nd}}$ quadrant)\n\n$\\therefore a \\sin B = b \\sin A$\n\n$\\therefore a \\sin B = c \\sin B = \\frac{\\sin A}{a} = \\frac{\\sin B}{b} = \\frac{\\sin C}{c}$\n\nNote: If we need to find an unknown angle using the sine rule, then $\\frac{\\sin A}{a} = \\frac{\\sin B}{b}$ is a more suitable form of the rule.",

The slope is $m$.\n\nFor example, if $3x - 4y + 3 = 0$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}\n- 4 y = - 3 x - 3 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 4 y = 3 x + 3 \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{3}{4} x + \\frac{3}{4} \\Rightarrow m = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\end{array}\n$$",

This method of proving geometric results was first used by a Greek mathematician named Euclid about 300 BC.\n\nThe proofs of numerous theorems are contained in his famous book on geometry called *Elements*. Today, over 2000 years later, we still use Euclid's approach to solve many problems in geometry.\n\nIn this section formal proofs of the theorems on your course are given.\n\nAn axiom is a statement accepted without proof. The angles in a straight line add to  $180^{\\circ}$  is an example of an axiom.\n\nA theorem is a statement that can be shown to be true through the use of axioms and logical argument.\n\nThese theorems are numbered as in the official syllabus.\n\nYou may be asked to reproduce the proofs of theorems 11, 12 and 13 only.\n\nA Corollary is a statement attached to a theorem which has been proven and follows obviously from it.\n\nNote 1. When we are asked to prove something in geometry it is important to give a reason for each deduction made. In a formal proof you must also provide the standard headings of \"To prove\", \"Given\", \"Construction\", \"Proof\"\n\nNote 2. A converse is where we check if the proposition and conclusion are switched is the statement true.\n\ne.g. In a right-angled triangle,  $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$  (where  $a, b$  and  $c$  are the lengths of the sides and  $c$  is the longest side (hypotenuse)).\n\nConverse: If  $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$  (where  $a, b$  and  $c$  are the lengths of the sides and  $c$  is the longest side (hypotenuse) is the triangle a right-angled triangle? Answer: Yes (the converse is true).\n\ne.g. If it is raining outside then the grass will be wet.\n\nConverse: If the grass is wet is it raining outside? Answer: Not necessarily.",

Differential calculus is mainly concerned with measuring the rate of change of one quantity with respect to another. For example, the speed of a car is the rate at which the distance it travels changes with respect to time. However, we know that a car is unlikely to travel at a constant speed, even for a short time. If a car is accelerating, it is changing speed by the second. If $60\\mathrm{km/hr}$ is registered on the speedometer, this tells us the instantaneous speed. Calculus is the mathematical tool that will enable us to find instantaneous rates of change.\n\n## Section 7.1 Average rate of change\n\nWe have already learned how to find the slope of a line if we are given two points on the line.\n\nThe slope, $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.\n\nWe will now refer to this slope as the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$.\n\nThe slope of a line will always be a fixed number as the slope is constant all along the line.\n\nThe curve on the right is the graph of a function $y = f(x)$.\n\nHow do we find the slope of a curve?\n\nThe slope of a curve at any point is defined as the slope of the tangent to the curve at that point.\n\n![img-565.jpeg](img-565.jpeg)\n\n![img-566.jpeg](img-566.jpeg)",

If we add the first three, we get $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nIf we add the first six numbers, we get $\\frac{63}{64}$.\n\nNotice that the more terms we add, the closer the result gets to 1 but it never reaches 1. In mathematics, we say that the limit of the sum of these numbers is 1.\n\nWe will now take the function $f(x) = x^2$ and consider its value as $x$ approaches 3 from below and above 3\n\n\u2460 $f(2) = 4; f(2.5) = 6.25; f(2.75) = 7.5625; f(2.9) = 8.41 \\ldots$\n\u2461 $f(4) = 16; f(3.5) = 12.25; f(3.25) = 10.5625; f(3.1) = 9.61 \\ldots$\n\nAs $x$ gets closer to 3, the value of $x^2$ gets closer to 9. 9 is said to be the limit of $f(x) = x^2$ as $x$ tends to 3.\n\nThis is written as $\\lim_{x\\to 3}(x^2) = 9.$\n\nWe generally use the abbreviation $\\mathbf{lim}$ for limit.\n\nIn general, to find the limit of $f(x)$, we substitute $a$ for $x$ in the function.\n\nFor example, $\\lim_{x\\to 2}\\frac{3x + 2}{x + 4} = \\frac{3(2) + 2}{2 + 4} = \\frac{8}{6} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nNow consider $\\lim_{x\\to 3}\\frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3}$.\n\nWhen we substitute 3 for $x$, we get $\\frac{9 - 9}{3 - 3} = \\frac{0}{0}$.\n\nThe result $\\frac{0}{0}$ is known as an indeterminate form as its value cannot be determined.\n\n![img-576.jpeg](img-576.jpeg)\n\n## Limit notation\n\n$\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x) = p$\n\nstates that $f(x)$ approaches $p$ as $x$ gets close to $a$.\n\nIf after substitution the result is $\\frac{0}{0}$, some other method must be found to obtain the limit.\n\nThe most common method used involves factorising the numerator and denominator and then dividing by the common factor.\n\nThus, $\\lim_{x\\to 3}\\frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3} = \\lim_{x\\to 3}\\frac{(x + 3)(x - 3)}{(x - 3)} = \\lim_{x\\to 3}(x + 3) = 6.$\n\n**Note:** It is important to realise that if $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3}$, then $f(3)$ does not exist, but the $\\lim_{x \\to 3}(x)$ does exist.",

This method becomes very tedious as the function becomes more complex.\n\nWe will now show how certain rules can be used to find the derivative of a function without having to use the method of differentiation from first principles.\n\nIt can be shown from first principles that if\n\n(i) $y = x^{2}$, then $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 2x$\n(ii) $y = 4x^{2}$, then $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 8x$\n(iii) $y = x^{3}$, then $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 3x^{2}$\n\nThe pattern in these derivatives suggests a general result which is given below:\n\n**Differentiation by rule**\n\n1. If $y = x^n$, then $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} = nx^{n-1}$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n2. If $y = ax^n$, then $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} = nax^{n-1}$\n\nIn words, this rule may be expressed as follows:\n\nTo differentiate a term containing a power (index) of $x$, multiply the coefficient by the power (index) and reduce the power (index) by 1.\n\n## Examples\n\n(i) $y = 3x^{2}$\n$\\Rightarrow \\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 6x$\n\n(ii) $y = 7x^{3}$\n$\\Rightarrow \\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 21x^{2}$\n\n(iii) $f(x) = 5x$\n$\\Rightarrow f'(x) = 5x^{0}$\n$= 5$\n\n(iv) $f(x) = 6x^4$\n$\\Rightarrow f'(x) = 24x^3$",

These include questionnaires, experiments and observations. Once data has been gathered, we must then concern ourselves with the description of data so that ordinary people can understand it. We can do this by representing the data graphically. You will meet a variety of graphical methods in this chapter, as shown below. These are known as descriptive statistics.\n\n![img-680.jpeg](img-680.jpeg)",

        "text": "Another way of making a large amount of data easily understood is by summarising the data. Data may be summarised by simply finding an average or some other number that could be representative of the data as a whole. These numbers are known as summary statistics.\n\nOne of the most widely-used and important statistical processes is concerned with gathering information from a small group of people (or items) and using this data to draw conclusions about a much larger group of people. A good example of this is provided by the opinion poll. A poll is taken of a few thousand people. From the information that these people provide, remarkably accurate conclusions can be drawn that refer to the whole population, which is many times greater in number. Collecting information from a small group to draw conclusions about a large group is known as inferential statistics.\n\n## Section 10.1 Types of data\n\nWhen we observe, count or measure something, we end up with a collection of numbers. These numbers are called data. Data is the plural of datum which means a piece of information.\n\n## 1. Numerical data\n\nData which can be counted or measured is called numerical data because the answer is a number. Numerical data can be either discrete or continuous.\n\n### Discrete data\n\nData which can take only certain individual values is called discrete data. Here are some examples of discrete data:\n\n- The number of goals scored by football teams on a Saturday\n- The number of desks in the classrooms of the school\n- The marks achieved in a test\n\n### Continuous data\n\nContinuous data is measured on some scale and can take any value on that scale. Here are some examples of continuous data:\n\n- The heights of students in your class\n- The speed of cars passing a certain point on a road\n- The time taken to complete a 100-metre sprint\n\n### Example 1\n\nFor each of these types of data, write down whether it is discrete or continuous.\n\n(i) the number of coins in your pocket\n(ii) the number of tickets sold for a concert\n(iii) the time taken to complete a puzzle\n(iv) the weights of students in your class\n(v) dress sizes\n\n(i) discrete\n(ii) discrete\n(iii) continuous\n(iv) continuous\n(v) discrete",

The government carries out a census of every person in the country every five years. Local government, education authorities and other organisations use the information obtained for further planning.\n\nData can be collected through direct observation such as a naturalist observing animal behaviour. In an observational study, the observer wishes to record data without interfering with the process being observed.\n\nApart from observational studies, data may also be collected by\n- carrying out a survey\n- doing an experiment\n- conducting interviews or completing questionnaires\n- using a data logger which records data or readings over a period of time, using a sensor.\n\n369",

Questionnaires\n\nOne of the most commonly-used methods of conducting a survey is by means of a questionnaire.\n\nA questionnaire is a set of questions designed to obtain data from individuals.\n\nPeople who answer questionnaires are called respondents.\n\nThere are two ways in which the questions can be asked.\n\n- An interviewer asks the questions and fills in the questionnaire.\n- People are given a questionnaire and asked to fill in the responses themselves.\n\nWhen you are writing questions for a questionnaire,\n\n- be clear on what you want to find out and what data you need\n- ask short, concise questions\n- start with simple questions to encourage the person who is giving the responses\n- provide response boxes where possible: Yes \u2610 No \u2610\n- avoid leading questions such as\n- \u2018Don\u2019t you agree that there is too much sport on television?\u2019\n- or \u2018Do you think that professional footballers are overpaid?\u2019\n- avoid personal questions such as,\n- \u2018Do you live in an affluent area?\u2019\n- or \u2018Are you well educated?\u2019\n- or \u2018Are you overweight?\u2019\n\nA choice of responses can be very useful in replying to the question, \u2018What age are you?\u2019\n\nHere is an example:\n\nTick your age in one of the boxes below:\n\nUnder 18 years \u2610 18\u201330 \u2610 31\u201350 \u2610 Over 50 \u2610",

A pilot survey is one that is carried out on a very small scale to make sure the design and methods of the survey are likely to produce the information required. It should identify any problems with the wording of the questions and likely responses.\n\n## 3. Designed experiments\n\nIn statistics, the word 'experiment' generally refers to a situation where the experimenter carries out some activity and records the results by counting or measuring or simply observing.\n\nThus an experiment may consist of\n\n- tossing three coins and recording the number of times two heads show\n- measuring the circumference of oak trees in a wood\n- throwing a dice several times to determine if it is biased\n- recording the side-effects of a new drug\n- investigating whether people are better at remembering words, numbers or pictures.\n\n## 4. Control group\n\nIf we wish to investigate whether a new drug has any effect on those who take it, we select a group of patients, chosen at random, to form a sample. The sample is then divided randomly into two groups. Both groups think that they are taking the new drug, but only the first group actually take it.\n\nThe second group are given an inactive substance (or placebo) but they think they have taken the drug. This second group is called a control group. If more patients get better in the first group, then the drug has an effect.",

This group is known as the population and it could be small, large or even infinite.\n\nExamples of populations include\n\n(i) all second-level pupils in Ireland\n(ii) paid-up members of golf clubs\n(iii) people entitled to vote in a general election.\n\nIf information is obtained from all members of a population, the survey is called a census.\n\n# Sample survey\n\nWhen a population is large, taking a census can be very time-consuming and difficult to do with accuracy. So when a census is ruled out as being impractical, information is normally taken from a small part of the population. The chosen members of the population are called a sample and an investigation using a sample is called a sample survey. Data from a sample can be obtained relatively cheaply and quickly. If the data is representative of the population, a sample survey can give an accurate indication of the population characteristic that is being studied.\n\nThe size of a sample is important. If the sample is too small, the results may not be very reliable.\n\nIf the sample is too large, the data may take a long time to collect and analyse.\n\nHowever, large samples are more likely to give reliable information than small ones.\n\n# Bias in sampling\n\nThe sample you select for your study is very important. If the sample is not properly selected, the results may be biased. If bias exists, the results will be distorted and so may not be representative of the population as a whole.",

If she stands outside a casino and questions people as they enter or leave, the results will be biased as these people are already involved in gambling.\n\n# Not identifying the correct population\n\nExample The school principal wants to find out about students' attitudes to school uniforms. She questions ten Leaving Certificate students only. This may lead to biased results as the opinions of the younger students (from 1st year to 5th year) are not included.\n\n# Failure to respond to a survey\n\nMany people do not fill in responses to questionnaires sent through the post. Those who do respond may not be representative of the population being surveyed.\n\n# - Dishonest answers to questions\n\n# Sampling methods\n\nThe purpose of sampling is to gain information about the whole population by selecting a sample from that population. If you want the sample to be representative of the population, you must give every member of the population an equal chance of being included in the sample. This is known as random sampling. Before a random sample is selected, a sampling frame must be used to identify the population. A sampling frame consists of all the items in the population to ensure that every item has a chance of being selected in the sample.\n\nSome of the most commonly-used sampling methods are given below.\n\n# 1. Simple random sampling\n\nA sample of size  $n$  is called a simple random sample if every possible sample of size  $n$  has an equal chance of being selected. In practice, this means that each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nThere are many ways of doing this.\n\nMethods for choosing a simple random sample could involve giving each member of the population a number and then selecting the numbers for the sample in one of these ways:\n\nputting the numbers into a hat and then selecting however many you need for the sample\nusing a random number table\nusing a random number generator on your calculator or computer\n\nAny of these methods are suitable only if the population is relatively small and the sampling frame is clearly identified.\n\n# 2. Stratified sampling\n\nMost populations contain identifiable strata. For example male / female or Retired / working / in education etc.\n\n|  <40 yrs | 40\u201360 yrs | >60 yrs  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  45% | 40% | 15%  |",

        "text": "Assume this table reflected the age distribution of a particular county. If samples are being used to determine preferences in music or film or technological innovation in this county and if the sample (randomly selected) contain proportions (of age) which do not reflect their proportion in the population then there will obviously be an inbuilt bias and a misleading view of the population.\n\nStratified sampling is used when the population can be split into separate groups or strata that are quite different from each other. The number selected from each group is proportional to the size of the group. Separate random samples are then taken from each group.\n\n## Example 1\n\nA survey to estimate the number of vegetarians in a mixed college with 660 boys and 540 girls is carried out.\n\nA sample of 40 students is required.\n\nHow many boys and girls should be included?\n\nThe total number of students is $660 + 540 = 1200$.\n\nBoys: $\\frac{660}{1200} \\times \\frac{40}{1} = 22$ boys\n\nGirls: $\\frac{540}{1200} \\times \\frac{40}{1} = 18$ girls\n\nSo 22 boys and 18 girls should be chosen.\n\n## 3. Systematic sampling\n\nA sample which is obtained by choosing items at regular intervals from an unordered list is called a systematic sample. For example, if you wish to choose 20 students from 200 students, you could take every tenth student from the register. Select a random number between 1 and 10, e.g., 4. Thus you could select the 4th, 14th, 24th, 34th ... until you get 20 students\n\n## 4. Quota sampling\n\nQuota sampling is widely used in market research and in opinion polls. First the population is divided into groups in terms of age, general education levels, social class, etc. The interviewer is then told how many people (the quota) to interview in each of these groups, but the interviewer makes the choice of who exactly is asked. A disadvantage of quota sampling is that the actual people or items chosen are left to the discretion of the interviewer which could lead to bias. An advantage of quota sampling is that no sampling frame is required.\n\n## 5. Cluster sampling\n\nIf the population is geographically widely spread, simple random sampling would be very difficult and very expensive. In this case the population is divided into clusters (regions). The smaller the cluster the better.\n\nA possible procedure is then:\n\n(i) Select a cluster (region) at random\n(ii) Select every member of the cluster or a random sample of members in each Cluster. Opinion polls generally use cluster sampling.",

For example, a sample of 40 students in a school could be selected by simply taking the first 40 names on the school register. Convenience sampling is very quick and easy to organise but it can lead to high levels of bias and so is very likely to be unrepresentative.\n\n## Example 2\n\nSimon wanted to investigate whether people in Ireland measured their height in metric or imperial units.

The sampling method used is convenience sampling. It may be biased as everyone chosen most likely lives in the same area and so may not provide a cross-section of social class and age-groups. Also, the sample is too small.\n\n(ii) A better method would be to use stratified sampling. In this way, you could ensure that men and women across all age-groups, different ethnic groups and different social classes were represented in the sample.\n\n## Exercise 10.3\n\n1. Explain briefly the difference between a **census** and a **sample**.\n\nGive two reasons why a sample may be preferred to a census.\n\n2. There are 100 students in Transition Year.\n\nGenerate random numbers on your calculator to select a sample of 10 students from Transition Year.\n\nDescribe briefly what is meant by a simple random sample.\n\n3. For each of the following methods, say whether it would give a random sample or whether it is likely to be biased:\n\n(i) Interview all the people in a local supermarket.\n\n(ii) Take every tenth person from a list.\n\n(iii) Put all the names in a hat and pick without looking.\n\n(iv) Test the first article produced each hour by a machine.\n\n(v) Number all the items and then select by using random number tables.",

These numbers are generally referred to as summary statistics.\n\nThere are two main types of summary statistic, namely, measures of location and measures of spread. Measures of location answer the question 'What value is typical of the values in the data?' Measures of spread answer the questions 'How much do the values vary?' or 'How spread out are the values?'\n\nIn this section, we will deal with measures of location or averages.\n\nThere are three different types of average in statistics.\n\nThese are the mode, the mean and the median.\n\n## 1. The Mode\n\nThe mode is the most common value in a set of data. The mode is very useful when one value appears much more often than any other. It is easy to find and can be used for non-numerical data such as the colours of cars sold by a car dealership.",

The Mean\n\nTo find the mean of a set of numbers,\n\n1. Find the sum of all the numbers.\n2. Divide this sum by the number of numbers.\n\nThe mean is the most frequently-used 'average'.\n\nIt is important because it considers every piece of data.

The range\n\nThe range of a set of data is the highest value of the set minus the lowest value.\n\nIt shows the spread of the data.\n\nIt is very useful when comparing two sets of data.\n\nThe range is a crude measure of spread because it uses only the largest and smallest value of the data.\n\nThe range of the numbers 14, 18, 11, 27, 21, 19, 33, 24 is\n\n$$\n\\text{Range} = 33 - 11 = 22\n$$\n\n&gt; The range of a set of data is the largest value minus the smallest value.\n\n### 2. Quartiles and Interquartile range\n\nWhen data is arranged in order of size, we have already learned that the median is the value halfway into the data. So we can say that the median divides the data into two halves.\n\nThe data can also be divided into four quarters.\n\nWhen the data is arranged in ascending order of size:\n\n- the lower quartile is the value one quarter of the way into the data\n- the upper quartile is the value three quarters of the way into the data\n- the upper quartile minus the lower quartile is called the interquartile range.\n\nThe lower quartile is written $Q_1$; the median is $Q_2$; the upper quartile is $Q_3$.\n\nConsider the following data which is arranged in order of size.

It shows how much variation there is from the average (mean). It may be thought of as the average difference of the scores from the mean, that is, how far they are away from the mean. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean; a high standard deviation indicates that the data is spread out over a large range of values.\n\nThe Greek letter $\\sigma$ is used to denote standard deviation.\n\nTake, for example, all adult men in Ireland. The average height is about $177\\mathrm{cm}$ with a standard deviation of about $8\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nFor this large population, about $68\\%$ of the men have a height within $8\\mathrm{cm}$ of the mean.\n\nIf the mean is $\\overline{x}$ and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of a large sample, then $68\\%$ will lie between $\\overline{x} + \\sigma$ and $\\overline{x} - \\sigma$\n\n## Procedure for finding the standard deviation\n\nThe steps used to find the standard deviation of a set of numbers are as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of the numbers. This is written $\\overline{x}$.\n2. Find the deviation (or difference) of each variable, $x$, from the mean. This is denoted by $(x - \\overline{x})$.\n3. Square each of these deviations, i.e., find $(x - \\overline{x})^2$.\n4. Find the sum $(\\Sigma)$ of these values, i.e., find $\\Sigma (x - \\overline{x})^2$.\n5. Divide this result by $n$, the number of numbers.\n\nThis gives $\\frac{\\Sigma(x - \\overline{x})^2}{n}$.\n\n6. Finally, get the square root of the result in 5.\n\nThere is no need to use this formula if you can remember the steps listed above.\n\nAlternatively, you may use a calculator.\n\nStandard deviation\n\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma (x - \\overline{x})^2}{n}}\n$$\n\n## Example 2\n\nFind the standard deviation of the numbers 6, 9, 10, 12, 13.\n\nThe mean $= \\frac{6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 13}{5} = \\frac{50}{5} = 10$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{(6 - 10)^2 + (9 - 10)^2 + (10 - 10)^2 + (12 - 10)^2 + (13 - 10)^2}{5}} \\\\\n= \\sqrt{\\frac{(-4)^2 + (-1)^2 + (0)^2 + (2)^2 + (3)^2}{5}} \\\\\n= \\sqrt{\\frac{16 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 9}{5}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{30}{5}} = \\sqrt{6} = 2.45 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n$\\therefore$ the standard deviation is 2.45",

If you are told that you are on the 70th percentile in a competitive test, this means that 70% of the competitors had scores lower than yours (or 30% higher than yours). It is important not to confuse percentiles with percentages. For example, you could achieve a score of 70% in a state examination but you could be at the 80th percentile.\n\nPercentiles are denoted by $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_{40}$ ...\n\n## How to find $P_k$ of a data set\n\nWhen asked to find the 40th percentile, $P_{40}$, we are required to find the value of the number that is 40% of the way into the data set.\n\nThus to find $P_k$ of a data set:\n\n1. Order the numbers in the data set from smallest to largest.\n2.

It is useful because it shows all the original data and also gives you the overall picture or shape of the distribution.\n\nIt is similar to a horizontal bar chart, with the numbers themselves forming the bars.\n\nStem and leaf diagrams are suitable only for small amounts of data.\n\nOften the stem shows the tens digit of the values and the leaves show the units digit. If you put them together, you get the original value.\n\nFor example 4|2 represents 42.",

(Avoid fractions, if possible.)\n\n$$\nx + 2y - 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -2y + 1\n$$\n\nWe now substitute $(-2y + 1)$ for $x$ in the equation of the circle.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}\n(-2y + 1)^2 + y^2 + 2(-2y + 1) + 8y - 8 = 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 4y^2 - 4y + 1 + y^2 - 4y + 2 + 8y - 8 = 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 5y^2 - 5 = 0 \\Rightarrow y^2 - 1 = 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad (y - 1)(y + 1) = 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad y = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y = -1 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFor each value for $y$, we find the corresponding $x$-value.\n\n$$\ny = 1 \\Rightarrow x = -1; \\quad y = -1 \\Rightarrow x = 3\n$$\n\nThe points of intersection are $(-1, 1)$ and $(3, -1)$.",

(i) Driver: Positively skewed as a lot of the data is clustered to the left in the (20-30) year age-group.\nPassenger: From ages (0-40) years, it is a symmetrical distribution with a mean of approximately 20 years. The values fall away as you move away from the centre.\n(ii) (a) Driver: 20 years\n(b) Passenger: 18 years\n(iii) A uniform distribution, suggesting casualties equally likely at all ages with moderate peak from (15-25) years.\n(iv) The (17-25) years age-group. Most of the casualties among both drivers and passengers occur in this group.\n\n4. (ii) Similarity: Both have the same mode (3). Difference: Girls distribution resembles a normal distribution. For the boys, most of the data is concentrated at the lower values (1-3).\n(iii) Though the medians are the same, the girls' distribution has a greater spread. The samples are sufficiently different to suggest that this could not happen by chance.\n(iv) They could include more boys and girls who are not in GAA clubs. Include both urban and rural children so the sample would be less biased. Also, be more precise about what 'playing sport' means.\n\n5. (i) A - run; B - cycle; C - swim\n(ii) 25 mins\n(iii) Approx. 3 mins\n(iv) It would be very unusual for two or more athletes to have the same time as it is continuous numerical data (times were to the nearest 1000th of a second).\n\n6.

This is the relative frequency of the next earthquake occurring between 100 and 200 days later.\n\n(v) The idea of 1000 deaths is very subjective as earthquakes occur in areas of low population also. An earthquake relatively low on the Richter Scale could result in a lot of deaths in a densely-populated area. So the size of the earthquake, as measured on the Richter Scale, may be more relevant to a future analysis than the number of deaths. Finally, the data may be divided by region and the frequency plotted against the size of the earthquake.\n\n# Chapter 11: Coordinate Geometry: The Circle\n\n## Exercise 11.1\n\n1.

It encourages the development of not only the students' knowledge and skills but also the understanding necessary to apply these skills.\n- The extensive range of imaginatively written and probing questions on each topic will help students understand the concepts involved and develop their problem-solving skills. Every attempt has been made to grade the questions in order of difficulty.\n- At the beginning of each chapter, there is a list of Key Words that students are expected to know and understand when the chapter is completed.\n- Each chapter concludes with a three-part revision exercise section consisting of (a) Core, (b) Advanced, and (c) Extended Response questions.\n\n![img-867.jpeg](img-867.jpeg)\n\n![img-868.jpeg](img-868.jpeg)\n\nThe Celtic Press\n\nwww.celticpress.ie\n\nThe Celtic Press, Ground Floor \u2013 Block B,\n\nLiffey Valley Office Campus, Dublin 22",
